# Porting Pandora's Box **Focus Point** game to Rust with Macroquad

## Issues found in Mac / Linux:

- resolution / first boot in fullscreen
- frequency of mouse events (too many repeats?)
- tinting of colors between triangle renders


## TODO List:

- defend against clicking without picking any piece
- fix fullscreen issue?
- fix tinting issue
- display photo credits once puzzle is complete
- animate or fade at piece swaps
