# Porting Pandora's Box **Focus Point** game to Rust with Macroquad

## Issues found in Mac / Linux:

- resolution / first boot in fullscreen (had to use custom branch)
- frequency of mouse events (too many repeats?)

## TODO List:

- display photo credits once puzzle is complete
- animate or fade at piece swaps
